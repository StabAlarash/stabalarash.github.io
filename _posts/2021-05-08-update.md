Hey !!!

So I wanted to be able to have the images besides the posts for instance but turns out that's not exactly how
jekyll works. At least as far as I understood, you need to have everything in assets/ has this got copied in the generated site.
Everything not starting with an underscore does apparently. I guess that'll do for now then.
